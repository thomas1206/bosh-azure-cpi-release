# Known Issues

1. The deployment of Cloud Foundry fails because of timeout when creating VMs

  1. This could be due to network glitch, which would be resolved through a retry.

    ```
    bosh -n deploy
    ```

    If this deployment succeeds, then you can skip the next step.

  2. If the above re-deployment failed again, please follow the below steps, keep the unreachable VMs for the further investigation, and file an issue [**HERE**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/issues).

    1. Delete your current Cloud Foundry deployment.

      ```
      bosh deployments # Get the name of the Cloud Foundry deployment
      bosh delete deployment CLOUD-FOUNDRY-DEPLOYMENT-NAME
      ```

    2. Delete your current BOSH deployment.

      ```
      bosh-init delete ~/bosh.yml
      ```

    3. Update `~/bosh.yml` if the debug option is not enabled.

      ```
      director:
        debug:
          keep_unreachable_vms: true
      ```

    4. Re-deploy BOSH.

      ```
      bosh-init deploy ~/bosh.yml
      ```

    5. Re-deploy Cloud Foundry.

      ```
      bosh deployment PATH-TO-YOUR-MANIFEST-FOR-CLOUD-FOUNDRY
      bosh -n deploy
      ```

    6. If the deployment failed, the unreachable VMs will be kept for further investigations.

2. Connection dropped

  By default, Azure load balancer has an `idle timeout` setting of 4 minutes but the default timeout of HAProxy is 900 as 15 minutes, this would cause the problem of connection dropped. [#99](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/issues/99)

  The timeout values of Azure load balancer and HAProxy need to be matched. There are two options:

  * Change the timeout of Azure Load Balancer to match HAProxy

    You can change the load balancer behavior to allow a [longer timeout setting for Azure load balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/load-balancer-tcp-idle-timeout/).

    Here is an example to change the timeout of Azure Load Balancer:

    ```
    azure network lb rule create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --lb-name $loadBalancerName --name "lbruletcp$tcpPort" --protocol tcp --frontend-port $tcpPort --backend-port $tcpPort --frontend-ip-name $frontendIPName --backend-address-pool-name $backendPoolName --idle-timeout 15
    ```

  * Change the timeout of HAProxy to match Azure Load Balancer

    You can change the default timeout of HAProxy in the manifest as bellows.

    ```
    request_timeout_in_seconds: 180
    ```

3. Limits of Premium Storage blob snapshots

  The BOSH snapshot operation may be throttled if you do all of the following:

  * Use Premium Storage for the Cloud Foundry VMs.

  * Enable snapshot in `bosh.yml`. For more information on BOSH Snapshots, please go to https://bosh.io/docs/snapshots.html.

    ```
    director:
      enable_snapshots: true
    ```

  * The time between consecutive snapshots by BOSH is less than **10 minutes**. The limits are documented in [Snapshots and Copy Blob for Premium Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-premium-storage/#snapshots-and-copy-blob). 

  The workaround is:

  * Disable snapshot temporarily.

    ```
    director:
      enable_snapshots: false
    ```

  * Adjust the snapshot interval to more than 10 minutes.

4. Version mismatch between CPI and Stemcell

  For CPI v11 or later, the compatible stemcell version is v3181 or later. If the stemcell version is older than v3181, you may hit the following failure when deploying BOSH.

  ```
  Command 'deploy' failed:
    Deploying:
      Creating instance 'bosh/0':
        Waiting until instance is ready:
          Sending ping to the agent:
            Performing request to agent endpoint 'https://mbus-user:mbus-password@10.0.0.4:6868/agent':
              Performing POST request:
                Post https://mbus-user:mbus-password@10.0.0.4:6868/agent: dial tcp 10.0.0.4:6868: getsockopt: connection refused
  ```

  It is recommended to use the latest version. For example, Stemcell v3232.5 or later, and CPI v12 or later. You may hit the issue [#135](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/issues/135) if you still use an older stemcell than v3232.5.

5. Invalid or expired service principal

  ```
  http_get_response - get_token - http error: 400
  ```

  Service principal is most likely invalid. Verify that client ID, client secret and tenant ID successfully work with the [steps](../get-started/create-service-principal.md#verify-your-service-principal).

  If your service principal worked and you get the above error suddenly, it may be caused by that your service principal expired. You need to go to Azure Portal to update client secret. By default, the service principal will expire in one year.

  1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), select `active directory` -- > ORGANIZATION-NAME -- > `Applications` -- > search your service principal name.

  ![Service Principal on Azure Portal](./service-principal-on-portal.png)

  2. Then choose your service principal, select `Configure` -- > `keys` -- > add a new key.
