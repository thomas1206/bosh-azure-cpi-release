There are two ways to run ASP.NET applications on Cloud Foundry: with "cflinuxfs2" stack or "windows2012R2" stack.

* "windows2012R2" stack
  * Requires Diego-Windows, Garden-Windows
  * Supports .NET SDK 3.5-4.5+
  * Uses binary_buildpack (applications are pre-compiled, no detect) to deploy the applications

* "cflinuxfs2" stack
  * Standard CF Linux Stack
  * Supports ASP.NET Core only
  * Uses community ASP.NET buildpack to deploy the applications

In this guide, you will learn how to run ASP.NET application on Cloud foundry with "cflinuxfs2" stack. If you need guide for running .NET application on Cloud foundry with "windows2012R2" stack, please go to this [guide](./README.md).

# Push your first .NET application to cloud foundry with "cflinuxfs2" stack on Azure

## 1 Prerequisites

* A deployment of Cloud Foundry with "cflinuxfs2" stack

  If you have followed the latest [guidance](../../guidance.md) via ARM templates on Azure to deploy BOSH and Cloud Foundry, you already have the environment ready.

## 2 Push your first ASP.NET application

1. Log on to your dev-box

2. Install CF CLI and the plugin

  ```
  wget -O cf.deb http://go-cli.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/releases/v6.14.1/cf-cli-installer_6.14.1_x86-64.deb
  sudo dpkg -i cf.deb
  ```

3. Configure your space

  Run `cat ~/settings | grep cf-ip` to get Cloud Foundry public IP.

  ```
  cf login -a https://api.REPLACE_WITH_CLOUD_FOUNDRY_PUBLIC_IP.xip.io --skip-ssl-validation -u USER -p PASSWORD
  cf create-space azure
  cf target -o "default_organization" -s "azure"
  ```

4. Download a demo ASP.NET application

  ```
  sudo apt-get -y install git
  git clone https://github.com/bingosummer/aspnet-core-helloworld
  ```

5. Push the application using ASP.NET buildpack. More info about ASP.NET buildpack, please refer to [link](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/dotnet-core-buildpack/blob/master/README.md)

  ```
  cd aspnet-core-helloworld
  cf push -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/dotnet-core-buildpack.git
  ```

  You will see push log like:
  ```
  requested state: started

  ```
## 3 Verify your deployment completed successfully

1. Open your web browser, type http://sample-aspnetcore-helloworld-nondiphtherial-nonlogicality.REPLACE_WITH_CLOUD_FOUNDRY_PUBLIC_IP.xip.io/. Now you can see your ASP.NET Page.
